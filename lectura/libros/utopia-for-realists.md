# Utopia for Realists

## opinion
Bregman's thesis is simple: we must adjust our notion of _utopia_ to fit modern-day standards. Human rights, and free healthcare (with varying degrees of quality and with a couple exceptions) are realities that we would have only dreamed of a couple of centuries ago. Today we believe that a universal basic income is impossible, or even counter-productive (people would be be lazy! they would be paid to do nothing!), but wouldn't it be nice? If you had your and your family's basic needs met, wouldn't you begin doing what you love rather than working a job you really don't like? That aspiration on its own, for Bregman, is enough to ask ourselves: why shouldn't we?

**quotes**

> Anywhere you find poor people, you find non-poor people theorizing about their cultural inferiority and dysfunction.

> Work is the refuge for people who have nothing better to do.

-   Oscar Wilde (1854 - 1900)

> Ironically, however, it has also created a system in which an increasing number of people can earn money without contributing anything of tangible value to society. Call it the paradox of progress: Here in the Land of Plenty, the richer and the smarter we get the more expendable we become.

> Let's get one thing straight, however. Making money without creating anything of value is anything but easy. It takes talent, ambition, and brains. And the banking world is brimming with clever minds. "The genius of the great speculative investors is to see what others do not, or to see it earlier", explains the economist Roger Bootle. "This is a skill. But so is the ability to stand on a tiptoe, balancing on one leg, while holding a pot of tea above your head, without spillage." In other words, the fact that something is difficult does not automatically make it less valuable.

> The bottom line is what wealth can be _concentrated_ somewhere, but that doesn't also mean that's where it's _being_ created.

> We live in a world where the going rule seems to be that the more vital your occupation (cleaning, nursing, teaching), the lower your rate in the GDP. As the Nobel laureate James Tobin said back in 1984, "We are throwing more and more of our resources, including the cream of our youth, into financial activities remote from the production of goods and services, into activities that generate high private rewards disproportionate to their social productivity."

> Yet this apparent decision is an illusion. The GDP is not a clearly defined object just waiting around to be "measured". To measure GDP is to seek to measure an idea.

> Keynes observed this tendency emerging even in his own day. "Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences," he wrote, "are usually the slaves of some defunct economist."
