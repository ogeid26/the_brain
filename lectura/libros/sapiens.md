## Pensamientos
A profoundly detailed narration of who we are and how we got there. Spoiler alert: humans and through narrations and teamwork. We often find the simple stories our ancestors use to tell to rationalize their environment (the God of their choice, nature, you name it) to be quite silly. But Harari holds that the contemporary stories that underlie our society (neoliberalism, Christianity, etc.) are no less "silly" when analyzed critically.
