# Difficult Women: a History of Feminism in 11 Fights

### quotes

**Introduction: An Imperfect History**

> We cannot celebrate women by stripping politics -and therefore conflict- from the narrative (...) It creates a story of feminism where all the opponents are either cartoon baddies or mysteriously absent, where no hard compromises have to be made, and internal disagreements disappear. The One True Way is obvious, and all Good People follow it.

> 'Those who profess to favour freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground', said [Frederick} Douglas.

> 'I myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is. I only know that people call me a feminist whenever i express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat, or a prostitute'

Rebecca West in 1913

> We are a class, united by common problems as much as we are divided by differences. Feminism must be broad enough to deal with the fact that other identities — lesbian, immigrant, adulterer— might hold women back as much as their sex.

**1. Divorce**

> But what i did in 2013 is something that the vast majority of women in history could only dream of doing, because getting divorced means something particular for women. It means that society considers you a full citizen, a person in your own right.

> The bill faced strong opposition in the Lords, where it was seen as an attack on the tradition of marriage —and therefore, the entire social system built around it.

> It isn't just people who have been divorced who owe Caroline Norton a debt; it's anyone who has ever had a wedding. Her campaign changed what marriage meant for women, moving it away from a purchase agreement and close to a deal between equals.

> When i got married in 2015, there was no way I was going to take my new partner's surname. As far as any name can be yours, 'Helen Lewis' was mine. Yes 'Lewis' is my father's name, passed down the male line, but it's also the one I've had since birth. It means me. And what other options do women have, anyway? The civil rights activist Malcom X dropped his surname altogether, writing in his autobiography that 'for me, my "X" replaced the white slavemaster name of "Little" which some blue-eyed devil named Little has imposed upon my paternal forebears.

> One of the hardest tasks of feminism is to expose how tradition gums up our vision, and makes us think that political choices are down to natural and immutable laws.

> Feminism should be less concerned with individual choices than the conditions in which they were made.

> As a feminist, victory if often bittersweet: the new reality quickly feels normal, obscuring the fight required to get there. **Progress erases struggle.**

> Our divorce law still need to be reformed. The presumption that mothers are the primary carers is being gradually eroded, which will inevitably affect 'access' to children after divorces. A less adversarial system, which favours dialogue over assigning blame, would benefit parents and their children.

> For centuries, marriage was used to control women —to suppress their difficulty, to stop them being unruly and independent. Divorce laws have traditionally done the same. They have encouraged us to put women's behaviour on trial, in the knowledge that they always be judged more harshly for their imperfections than men.

**2. The Vote**

> Christabel Pankhurst was frustrated. After half a century of petitions, peaceful demonstrations and pleading, women still not have the vote.

> At the court, Christabel tells the (male) prosecutors and the (male) magistrates that their rowdiness is understandable: 'We cannot make any orderly protest because we have not the means whereby citizens may do such a thing; we have not a vote; and so long as we have not votes we must be disorderly... if we were citizens we should be law-abiding.'

> Sylvia [Pankhurst] was also more alert to what we would now call intersectionality —the idea that different oppressions intersect with one another. She later became involved in the anti-colonial movement.


**10. Abortion**

> Our culture gazes too intensely at girls, seeing only the surface, then look straight through women as they age.

> It is a difficult principle to accept, but women deserve less access to abortion even when we don't agree with their reasons for having one.

> The US religious right is also bringing forward so-called 'personhood laws', which chip away at _Roe v. Wade._ These laws aim to enshrine the idea that a foetus —whether minutes from birth or a recently fertilised egg— is a legal entity under the law. But the more the foetus is treated as a person, the less its mother is.

> It suits conservatives to frame abortion as a moral issue: they are protecting precious human life. I would find this argument more compelling if advanced by pacifists who believed in generous state funding of maternity services and a strong welfare safety net. From the US right, which will not support a ban on the sale of military assault rifles to the public, and which has stripped away healthcare provision from the poor, it is deeply hypocritical. If life begins at conception, why does their interest in protecting it end at birth?

> In 1931, Virginia Woolf gave a lecture to a society for professional women, in which she identified another problem with the Angel in the house — Angels were nice: writers can't be.

> "I found, directly I put even to paper, you cannot review even a novel without having a mind of your own, without expressing what you think to be the truth about human relations, morality, sex. And all these questions, according to the Angel of the House, cannot be dealt with freely and openly by women; they must charm, they most conciliate, they must —to put it bluntly— tell lies if they are to succeed... Killing the Angel in the House was part of the occupation of a woman writer."

> A century and a half ago, women could not vote, own property or control their own fertility. Since then, we have taken a half-step towards equality, which brings its own difficulties. An unfinished revolution is messier than starting a fresh war. Feminism has won battle after battle, but it can be hard to keep going when howling injustices into stubborn inequalities.

> 'The "man shortage" and the "infertility epidemic" are not the price of liberation,' wrote Susan Faludi in 1992. 'In fact, they do not even exist. But these chimeras are the chisels of a society-wide backlash. They are part of the relentless whittling-down-process —much of it amounting to outright propaganda— that has served to stir women's private anxieties and break their political wills.'
