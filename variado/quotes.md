> We write to taste life twice. In the moment and in retrospect.

> We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.

Anais Nin

> If you're a fascist and anti-fascists come for you, you have a choice. You can give up, you can go renounce what you said, you could just go on with the rest of your life ans stop turning up at fascist rallies. Anti-fascists aren't gonna buy you a pint and be your friend but they'll move on. But if you're a person of color, if you're trans, or a person with a disability, or gay, or Jewish, and fascist come for you, there is nothing you can do that can make them happy, except stop existing. That's the key difference between the far left and the far right: anti-fascists organize themselves against those that are building fascism. If you're doing that, that is something you can non-violently stop doing. If you're a political enemy of antifa, you can become a friend. If you're a political enemy of fascism, either they lose or you die.

It doesn't walk in saying, "Our programme means militias, mass imprisonments, transportations, war and persecution."

Michael Rosen

> We'll never agree on things. the left will always be the left and the right will always be the right, but the absurd caricatures we've built for each others are entirely unrepresentative of real people - and the more real people we meet, the more rational we might be moving forward.

> Yo los entiendo a todos ustedes, ¿pero quién me entiende a mí?
