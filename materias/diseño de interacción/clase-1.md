# UX vs CX

### User Experience

Person actually using the software or product

### Customer Experience

The purchaser. The one giving us money.

# UX Design Characteristics

## Usable

Improving usability or making something easier to use. This means that the design, structure, and purpose of the product is clear and easy to use for everyone.

## Equitable

Being equitable means your designers are useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds. Equity goes beyond the concept of equality.

## Enjoyable

The design delights the user. The design reflects that the user may be thinking or feeling and creates a positive connection with them.

## Useful

It solves user problems. The design intentionally solves an identified user problem.

> The strange thing about UX design is that you won’t really notice if it’s good design. You only notice it when it’s bad.
